"""Static fast path that flags test assertions which cannot fail.

The scan reads test files with the ast module and looks for four
shapes. A mock whose return value is assigned a value and later
asserted equal to that same value. The same shape where the mock
was configured inside a helper or a fixture in the same file and
bound to the test under another name. An assertion that compares
an expression with itself. An assertion on the constant true
value.

Slice 5 gates every shape on the assertion sitting inside a test
function, where what counts as a test function follows the
python_functions setting of the analysed project under G2. The
maps the scan builds stay file wide, because a helper is not a
test function and is never required to be one for the test that
binds its mock to be flagged.

Slice 6 retires the fixture parting on both paths. A definition
that carries a fixture decorator is not a test function for the
scan and never a selectable item for the selector, under the one
reading of the fixture spellings in this module, with the carve
outs H3 states for TestCase classes and fixture decorated
classes on the verdict path.

Slice 8 retires the duplicate name limit FIX-24 recorded. The
fixture condition of the scan gate is read on the effective
definition of a governing definition name, the last definition
of that name in the body that holds it, and the helper and
fixture maps clear both of their entries on a redefinition, so
the last definition alone decides what a name supplies.

Slice 9 widens the fixture form of D5 beyond the analysed file.
The fixture definitions of the project conftest files on the
chain for a test file join the fixture table the form reads,
under the precedence K2 states, so a test consuming a conftest
supplied fixture is flagged the way a test consuming a fixture
defined in its own file is flagged. A conftest contributes
fixtures and never helpers, and the supply reaches the scan
only, because the runs have always resolved it themselves.
